# flexibleapis

This repository accompanies a series of blog posts giving very brief introductions to some higher level functional abstractions in Java.  The code doesn't currently stand on its own, you should read the posts to get an idea what is going on.  There is a package for each post conatining all of the code used in that post.  In each package the Demo class is the main class that has some sample code to exercise the API.
